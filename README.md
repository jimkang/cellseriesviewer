cellseriesviewer
================

This is a small web app that displays series of cells generated by a cellular automaton. It expects cells to be in this kind of format:

    {
      "d": {
        "name": "cello",
        "p": 1
      },
      "coords": [
        2,
        1
      ]
    }

cellseriesviewer will show sets of cells at the first iteration, then will show them at the next iteration when you hit Next.

Installation
------------

    npm install cellseriesviewer

Usage
-----

Edit cellseries-config.js file to provide information about your series.

    var seriesData = [
      {
        id: 'default-cell-layer',
        url: 'location-of-a-file-containing-an-array-of-sets-of-cells.json',
        offset: [0, 550]
      }
    ];

You can have as many objects within the seriesData array as like. Each object represents a group of cells. The offset specifies where in the SVG they should rendered. The url points to a JSON file containing an array.

That outer array should contain *iterations*. Each iteration should be an array containing the the state of each cell in the series at that iteration.

Start a web server, then open the index.html to view your cell series.
